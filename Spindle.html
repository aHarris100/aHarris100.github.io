		<h1>Spindle the Spider</h1>

		<img src="spinny2.jpg">


<p>Spindle the Spider lives in the corner of a boring, rickety porch, her web a simple, claustrophobic affair that does little to inspire her adventurous spirit. Day after day, she watches the world go by from her dull corner, yearning for something more, something exciting and new.</p>

<p>One day, as she sits in her web, a gust of wind blows through the porch, carrying with it the scent of distant lands and untold adventures. Spindle's curiosity is piqued, and she decides that enough is enough. It's time to break free from her mundane existence and go on an adventure.</p>
