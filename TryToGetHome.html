		<h1>Walking Home</h1>

	<p>Spindle becomes tired of waiting in this depressing, uninteresting cave. She wishes to return to her web on the porch as soon as possible!</p>

<p></p>

<p>She anxiously tries to return home, her small legs skittering across the ground as she navigates the rising waves. The once-gentle brook has become a raging river, with a powerful and punishing current. Spinner's pulse races as she struggles against the tremendous stream, her instinct for survival propelling her forward.</p>

<p>Despite her best efforts to cling to a nearby branch or leaf, Spindle is overpowered by the flood. The rushing water carries her farther and farther away from the safety of the porch, and soon she is lost to sight, disappearing into the murky depths below.</p>

<p>Days pass, and there is no sign of Spindle. Her absence is felt by the creatures of the porch, who miss her quiet presence and the beauty of her delicate web. They search for her in vain, but Spindle is gone, lost to the waters that whisked her away.</p>
